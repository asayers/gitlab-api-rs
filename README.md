## Synopsis

[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) is an amazing tool. For most of the tasks, the web UI is more than enough but for some tasks nothing beats scripting them. The [GitLab API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/) is there to allow scripting actions on the GitLab server.

The excellent [python-gitlab](https://github.com/gpocentek/python-gitlab) allows to use the API from Python, but when playing with it I find myself missing [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)'s static typing. Hence this implementation in Rust.

The (v3) API is quite long, so the parts I need will be implemented first.


## What Works

* Read-only listing:
    * Groups;
    * Issues;
    * Merge Requests;
    * Projects (admin all, user's, specific id, owned, search);


## What Doesn't Work

* Any _write_ commands (`POST`, `PUT`, etc.)
* Any _Enterprise Edition_-specific features.
* API elements using arrays.

    For example [listing merge requests, filtering  with multiple `iid`s](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/merge_requests.html#list-merge-requests):

    ```
    GET /projects/:id/merge_requests?iid[]=42&iid[]=43
    ```
* Some projects listing:
    * branch;
    * branches;
    * events;
    * hook;
    * hooks;
    * starred;
    * visible;


## Usage


```
[dependencies]
gitlab-api = "0.4.0"
```

This crate uses a builder pattern to add filters to a query. Once the query is built, `list()` will commit it by contacting the GitLab server and performing the request.

```
extern crate gitlab_api as gitlab;

fn main() {
    let gl = gitlab::GitLab::new(&"gitlab.com", &"GITLAB_TOKEN_XXXXXXX");

    // Get GitLab's version.
    let gitlab_version = gl.version();
    println!("gitlab_version: {:?}", gitlab_version);

    // Get projects, owned by authenticated user and which are archived.
    let projects = gl.projects().owned().archived(true).list();
    println!("projects: {:?}", projects);

    // Get groups owned by authenticated user.
    let owned_groups = gl.groups().owned().list();
    println!("owned_groups: {:?}", owned_groups);

    // Get closed issues.
    let closed_issues = gl.issues().state(gitlab::issues::State::Closed).list();
    println!("closed_issues: {:?}", closed_issues);
}
```

**NOTES**:
* Crate uses `https` by default. Use `GitLab::new_insecure()` to use `http` (or `port()` and `sheme()` setters on `GitLab` struct).
* Sending your token in clear over `http` is dangerous!
* See [examples/list_projects.rs] for an example of how to load the token (and the hostname) from an environment variable.
